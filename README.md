# City-Correlations-project
using centre for cities dataset to look for insights.

very rough coding for first github uplaod but with room to improve, i Have downloaded data from the website <a href=https://www.centreforcities.org/>centre for cities</a> with the uk dataset.

one of the insights i've been looking for is any correlations, intuaitvly i thought, maybe cities with larger share of knowledge intensive indisutries would have higher per hour output.
it came back as around 0.7 which is a strong posistive correlation.

things to do. 
think about more class based functions for easier reading
explore different insights
move data from local host to online server, maybe mongodb atlas... or include limited data with files here?
expand to the eueropeancities dataset, so can do comparative study on similar sized cities.
